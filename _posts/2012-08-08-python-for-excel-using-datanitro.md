title: Python for Excel using DataNitro
---

[DataNitro](http://www.datanitro.com), formerly known as IronSpread is a wonderful tool bringing feature-rich python to Excel.

I've got some sort of a screencast here to show you how Excel and python(DataNitro) form a fantastic combination.

Will try and tell you how this was done in the coming posts. For now, watch the video to get a taste of it, and you could start playing around with it.
