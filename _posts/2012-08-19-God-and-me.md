**Psalm 7:1 - 'O LORD my God, in You I put my trust...'**

Worldly wisdom, knowledge, wealth, fame, pleasures, family, & friends would fail, but God who gave His only Son Jesus Christ for me - He who washed my sins away by His blood will never fail. I'm safe in the arms of Jesus.
 
Poverty or riches, life or death, in need or contentment, whatever my state be, I put my trust in Him. His grace is sufficient for me.
