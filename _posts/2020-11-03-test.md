title: Python Programming on Win32
---

Struck by the power of [DataNitro](https://datanitro.com/) and inspired by [this](http://www.s-anand.net/blog/automating-powerpoint-with-python/) post, I decided to learn <strike> more </strike>  about Excel COM objects. After wandering through stuff Google offered, I've finally settled with **[Python Programming on WIN32](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-WIN32-Windows-Programmers/dp/1565926218)**. I'm into the initial pages and I seem to like it. So far so good. I know I'm not going to understand every line but one fine summer day the light bulb will glow. Worth it!!
