The word cloud you see is a picturised version of this [article](http://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/article3739136.ece). The size of each word is determined by its frequency in the text. 

A word cloud attempts in picturising the general mood or tone of a narrative. Yes, it is not perfect since word-play and context are not part of the logic of creating the visual here. But you could study anything for which 'frequency' plays a major role.

If you haven't created word clouds before and would like to do something like the one above, try [**Wordle**](http://www.wordle.net/). Its free and you dont need a degree from MIT to get it to work.

Now how about using [**Tagxedo**](http://www.tagxedo.com/) to add some shape to these picturised texts like this one.
